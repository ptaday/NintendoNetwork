## Description

The NintendoNetwork project is a VB.Net network management software designed to help the Stony Brook Basement Club manage their massively multiplayer Nintendo 64 Donkey Kong league. The software models the network as a tree with two types of nodes: Nintendo Nodes (representing Donkey Kong players with Nintendo64 devices) and Raspberry Nodes (used as routers). The network management software allows the user to view the network topology, load and save it from a file, add nodes, remove subtrees, and identify the root of the minimal subtree containing all the failures for a given scenario.
